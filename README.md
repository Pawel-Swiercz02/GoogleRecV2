# GoogleRecV2
Recreation of the Google home page version 2. (In Polish this time)

Looks much cleaner, because I used darker and better matched colors.

I also got a little better using the flexbox so all the elements are in the same place as on the actual google home page.

This time I included every little detail, like the shadow that appears while hovering over the little dotted icon in the top right corner. It's a small detail but I really wanted the site to be an exact copy of the Google home page.

PS: When I learn CSS animations, I'm definitely going to make the search bar function properly (maybe even add a little data base for search queries that appear once you type something in - probably going to use phpmyadmin for that since I learned that in school). I'll definitely add the menu that appears when you click on your logo to switch profiles and also the menu with gmail, google docs etc. when you click on the dotted icon.

PPS: That's not my cat on the logo, it's just a copyright-free stock photo.
