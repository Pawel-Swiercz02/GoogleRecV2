# GoogleRecV2
Recreation of the Google home page version 2 (looks much better)
Live site here: https://google-recreation-v2.netlify.app
Looks much cleaner, because I used darker and better matched colors.
I also got a little better using the flexbox so all the elements are in the same place as on the actual google home page.
This time I included every little detail, like the shadow that appears while hovering over the little dotted icon in the top right corner. It's a small detail but I really wanted the site to be an exact copy of the Google home page.
